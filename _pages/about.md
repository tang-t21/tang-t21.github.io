Hi! I am Tian Tang (唐添), a senior undergraduate student at Yao Class, Tsinghua University. I have a broad interest in the intersection of Artificial Intelligence and Computer Systems, with a focus on building efficient system support for AI applications.

Currently I am working with Prof. [Baris Kasikci](https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~baris/) at University of Washington.
I was fortunate to be advised by Prof. [Mingyu Gao](http://people.iiis.tsinghua.edu.cn/~gaomy/) in my junior year.

**I am applying for Ph.D. programs starting from Fall 2025**. If you are hiring or interested in my research, please feel free to contact me through email.

Miscellaneous:
======
I love sports, especially basketball and badminton. I am a fan of the NBA team Los Angeles Clippers.
I also go to the gym regularly.

I love music, both pop and classical. I play the violin. There are some of my favorite pieces:
The butterfly lovers violin concerto, Czardas by Monti, and the violin concerto in D major by Tchaikovsky.
